        Include all sniffs in the PEAR standard. Note that the
        path to the standard does not have to be specified as the
        PEAR standard exists inside the PHP_CodeSniffer install
        directory.

    <!--
        Here we are including a specific sniff but also changing
        the error message of a specific message inside the sniff.
        Note that the specific code for the message, which is
        CommentFound in this case, is defined by the sniff developer.
        You can display these codes by using the -s command line
        argument when checking a file.

        Also note that this message has a variable inside it,
        which is why it is important that sniffs use a printf style
        format for their error messages.

        We also drop the severity of this message from the
        default value (5) so that it is hidden by default. It can be
        displayed by setting the minimum severity on the PHP_CodeSniffer
        command line. This is great if you want to use some messages
        only in code reviews and not have them block code commits.
